\f0\fs24 \cf2 \cb3 ROOT4FLORIDA, an iOS app to help Floridians plant a native landscape. \
\
\
DESCRIPTION: \
\
This app allows users to plan and maintain their yards in an eco-friendly way. A user will input their zip code and receive a list of plans that are native to their area. They can also apply sun filters (full sun, partial shade, full shade) and color filters (black, blue, green, mixed, orange, pink, purple, red, white, and yellow) to better narrow down their plant list. There is also a search option that will allow a user to further filter their plant list to find more specific plants they are looking for, eg. if a user inputs 'roses' to the search bar they will receive a list of roses that are native to their environment. \
\
The plant list generated will contain a photo of the plant, the name of the plant, and if you click on the plant name a more in-depth description of the plant itself. There is also a favorites option where a user can favorite a plant to save it. A Favorites Only toggle when chosen will only list plants the user has favorited. \
\
The app also syncs up with an iPhone's Reminders app. Through this, a user can create a reminder to help maintain the upkeep of their garden. The reminder will then be available on the Root4Florida app and the Reminders app. \
\
There is also a Tips section. Here is a list of helpful composting and general gardening tips. \
\
\
HOW TO COMPILE: \
To compile the app open the .xcodeproj file with Xcode. The code is written in Swift 5.5.1 using Xcode 13.1. To run the project press the play button on the top left corner of the screen. The iOS Simulator will pop up with the code open. From there, you can navigate through the app. \
To access the reminders portion of the app, a you will need to allow the app access to the Reminders app. This can be done through a popup window upon opening the app. \
